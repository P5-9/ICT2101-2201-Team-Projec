# Ambulance Workload Management System
This project is the creation of a workload management system for the ambulance team of a major hospital. Our team provided an informative overview of staff workload by creating an interactive and user-friendly application that would allow quick viewing of important information, such as their job assignments, task allocations, and also their availability.
